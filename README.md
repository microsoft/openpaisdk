# OpenPAI JS SDK
[![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.org/microsoft/openpaisdk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/microsoft/openpaisdk)

The `JavaScript` SDK is designed to facilitate the developers of [OpenPAI](https://github.com/microsoft/pai) to offer user friendly experience. 

The SDK mainly provides client side sharable functions such as RESTful API wrapping, error handling, storage accessing and processing of [job protocol](). 

It could be used to support existing or future front-ends (e.g. Web Portal, VS Code extension, Command Line Interface, Jupyter Notebook extension, and 3rd party clients), and also could be used to simplify the design of [kube runtime plugins](), which are executed in init containers.

*Now we are porting some of the functions from existing `Python` [SDK](github.com/microsoft/pai/contrib/python-sdk) and command line tool. The whole functionality of this SDK will be ready soon.*

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save microsoft/openpaisdk
```

Initialize the `openPAIClient`

```ts
const cluster: IPAICluster = {
    username: '<username>',
    password: '<password>',
    token: '<token>',
    rest_server_uri: '<The host>/rest-server'
};
const openPAIClient = new OpenPAIClient(cluster);
```

### Installation of CLI tool

The SDK offers a command line interface (CLI) prefixed by `pai`. For end users that use CLI only, we provide an easy way to install it via `pip` and the `Python` package `nodeenv`. 

```bash
pip install nodeenv
nodeenv myenv
myenv/Scripts/activate
npm i -g microsoft/openpaisdk
```

This installation commands will generate a virtual environment with latest `node` in the directory `./myenv`, and install the CLI in it. Then user could use `pai` command by any of below methods

- activate the virtual environment first
    ```bash
    myenv/Scripts/activate
    pai -h
    ```
- use a absolute path to `pai`
    ```bash
    myenv/Scripts/pai -h
    ```
- add `myenv/Scripts` to environment variable `path`


## RESTful API
The SDK provides ease-of-use `JavaScript` and `TypeScript` wrapping of  [OpenPAI RESTful APIs](https://github.com/microsoft/pai/blob/master/docs/rest-server/API.md). 

Details are in [rest-api.md](docs/rest-api.md).

## Storage Operations

Multiple types of storages are supported by OpenPAI, however, the end user and developers should not be bothered by too much details of it. The SDK provides an abstract storage accessing methods to let users access the storages.

User could get the `IStorageNode` object for each cluster provisioned storage by 
```ts
// get a storage object with its name
let storageDetail: IStorageDetail = await opanPAIClient.storage.getStorageByName(name)
let storageNode: IStorageNode = new StorageNode(storageDetail)
```
It would provide storage accessing methods (`getinfo, listdir, makedir, upload, download, delete`) and CLI storage operations.

Details are in [storage.md](docs/storage.md).

## Local Cluster Management

In some scenarios (e.g. cli or notebook extension), it is required to store the cluster information locally.

## Unified error handling

The SDK will center the error handling, thus all front ends depending on it could share the same way to warn users.

## Common job config processing

The interoperation of `OpenPAI` components depends on the [job protocol](github.com/microsoft/openpaiprotocol), and there have been some common operations of it, such as validation, preprocessing before submission (e.g. embedding essential user information). The SDK will provide essential common operations for all the front ends.
